Key concepts in TypeScript include:

Types: TypeScript adds static types (e.g., string, number, boolean, any) to JavaScript, allowing for compile-time type checking and better error detection.

Interfaces: Define the shape of objects, enforcing the structure and types that objects must adhere to. They are useful for creating contracts in code.

Type Annotations: You can explicitly declare variable and function types (e.g., let age: number), ensuring the correct types are used throughout your code.

Type Inference: TypeScript can automatically infer types based on the values assigned, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.

Union and Intersection Types: Union (|) allows a variable to be multiple types, while intersection (&) combines multiple types into one.

Generics: Allows functions and classes to work with multiple types while maintaining type safety, e.g., function<T>(arg: T).

Modules: Use import and export to modularize your code, promoting reusability and maintainability.

Decorators: Provide a way to modify or annotate classes and methods, commonly used in frameworks like Angular.

Enums: Define a set of named constants, improving code readability for sets of related values.

Advanced Types: Concepts like mapped types, conditional types, and utility types provide powerful ways to handle complex type transformations.

These concepts form the backbone of TypeScript, offering flexibility, type safety, and improved developer experience compared to plain JavaScript.`;
